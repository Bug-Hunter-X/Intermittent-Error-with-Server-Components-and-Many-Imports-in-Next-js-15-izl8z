# Intermittent Error with Server Components and Many Imports in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates an intermittent error encountered when using server components in Next.js 15 with a significant number of imports. The issue manifests inconsistently, making debugging challenging.

## Problem Description

The application, built with Next.js 15, incorporates server components. Under certain conditions (possibly related to the number of imports within a server component), the application throws an unexpected error. This error does not occur consistently and its cause is not readily apparent. 

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the application behavior. The error is intermittent; you may need to refresh the page or restart the development server multiple times to trigger it.  

## Potential Causes (Speculative)

* **Import Optimization:** A potential issue lies within Next.js's import optimization strategy for server components, particularly when a large number of modules are involved. 
* **Resource Limits:**  It's possible that the error relates to resource limitations during the server component's compilation or execution.
* **Caching Issues:** Intermittent caching behavior might also be a contributing factor.
