//Potential Solutions to try:
// 1. Code Splitting: Break down large server components into smaller, more manageable chunks to reduce the number of imports in each component.
// 2. Dynamic Imports:  Use dynamic `import()` statements to load modules only when needed. This can improve the initial load time and reduce the burden on the server.
// 3. Optimization Flags: Investigate if Next.js offers any configuration options to optimize imports or improve server-side component performance. 
// 4. Dependency Analysis: Review all dependencies to identify if there are any unnecessary imports or circular dependencies that might contribute to the issue.
// 5. Next.js Version: If the issue persists, consider upgrading to the latest version of Next.js to benefit from any potential bug fixes or performance improvements related to server components.
